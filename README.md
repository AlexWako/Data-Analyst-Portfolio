Hi, I am Alessandro Wako or Alex Wako and I am a recent graduate of University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science. I have around a year of experience as a data analyst and a passion of discovering meaningful insight using data. I am eager to bring my skills to the field and believe my adaptability will be an asset for any entry-level analyst position.
