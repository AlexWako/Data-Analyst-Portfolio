## About

Hi, I am Alessandro Wako or Alex Wako, and this repository is a means to showcase and share some of my skills as a Data Analyst. I recently graduated with a B.S. in statistics and data science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and I also have around a year of experience as a data analyst. I have a passion for discovering meaningful insight using data, and I am eager to bring my skills to the field, believing my adaptability will be an asset for any entry-level analyst position.

## Projects

This section is a list of some data analytics projects I have completed and a short description of it.

### Python

#### [OD App](https://github.com/AlexWako/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/ODApp)

**Description:** The goal of the project was to develop an in-house application for the organization to assist with data management and deal with fulfillment. 

**Skills:**

#### [Exploratory Data Analysis of the World Happiness Report 2008-2023](https://github.com/AlexWako/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/World-Happiness-Report)

**Description:** The goal of the project was to answer the question: "Is there evidence that a newborn can lead to a healthy long life given the happiness of the country?" The process involved cleaning and preparing the data into a state that it can be statistically modeled, including using a correlation matrix and principal component analysis. Then the data was trained and tested on two multi-linear regression model with one ignoring the results of the principal component analysis. The result found showed that there is not a strong relationship between the happiness of a country and a healthy long life, but some factors the data used to find the happiness index of each country were factors that increased a healthy long life.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualizaiton, Data Modeling, Python(Numpy, Pandas, Altair)

### R

#### [2023 NBA Player Positional Analysis](https://github.com/AlexWako/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Basketball%20Project)

**Description:** The goal of the project was to discover if the recent statements of 'positionless basketball' is true. This is not to say that each player cannot be assigned a position to play, but the responsibility of each position has homogenized and that a player given one position can participate or take on the responsibility of another player from another position. The project involved finding and loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analsyis, and implementing clusters to organize the players from the data. As a result, I found some positions to be interchangeable over others, such as the point guard being mostly exclusive, while forwards, centers, and shooting guards can swap positions.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Modeling, R, Rmarkdown
