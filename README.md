## About
Hi, I am Alessandro Wako or Alex Wako, and this repository is a means to showcase and share some of my skills as a Data Analyst. I recently graduated with a B.S. in statistics and data science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and I also have around a year of experience as a data analyst. I have a passion for discovering meaningful insight using data, and I am eager to bring my skills to the field, believing my adaptability will be an asset for any entry-level analyst position.
