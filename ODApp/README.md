## OD App

The OD app is an application I made for the organization I interned at from April 2023 to December 2023. I got the opportunity to design my own project as part of my internship, so I decided to make an application to complete tedious tasks and manage product data. Some of the tools included in this app are:

- Fufill Order
- Edit Measurement
- Competitor Change
- Add Jean (to database)
