## OD App

The OD app is an application I made for the organization I interned at from April 2023 to December 2023. I got the opportunity to design my own project as part of my internship, so I decided to make an application to complete tedious tasks and manage product data. Some of the tools included in this app are:

- Fufill Order
- Edit Measurement
- Competitor Change
- Add Jean (to database)

### Fulfill Order

The fulfill order functions as a connection to Shopify's backend. Specifically, the fulfillment of orders of customers made during the day. DHL and FedEx shipments come with an end-of-day report storing important data in a CSV file. Using that file, the app submits the data found in the CSV file into Shopify, fulfilling orders that could otherwise take an hour to finish.

### Edit Measurement

The edit measurement functions as another connection to Shopify's backend. Manually creating a table for each measurement of a product can take a long time out of a productive day, so I made a program that can instantly turn the measurements we record on Excel into measurements visible to customers through Shopify.
